# Employee-Onboarding-System-Salesforce-Project
Automates and streamlines employee onboarding using Salesforce custom objects and automation.

Overview
The Employee Onboarding System aims to automate and streamline the onboarding process for new employees within organizations using Salesforce. This phase focuses on understanding the real business challenges, requirements, and industry fit for the solution.

Requirement Gathering
Engaged with HR managers, IT staff, and new employees to collect onboarding pain points and expectations.

Conducted interviews and surveys to capture both functional and non-functional requirements, such as process transparency, automation, and security needs.

Identified the need for tracking document submission, role assignment, task allocations, and compliance checks.

Stakeholder Analysis
Primary stakeholders: HR department, new hires, IT support.

Secondary stakeholders: payroll team, compliance officers, line managers.

Analysed and mapped each stakeholder’s objectives and expectations with system requirements.

Business Process Mapping
Developed current “as-is” process flowcharts and outlined “to-be” automated Salesforce workflows.

Mapped each step in the onboarding journey (document collection, user provisioning, first-day tasks) to Salesforce objects and automations.

Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis
Reviewed HR onboarding best practices across IT, consulting, and service sectors.

Compared different onboarding solutions to identify key differentiators and adopt industry standard modules (e.g., document verification, welcome kits, training assignments).

AppExchange Exploration
Explored Salesforce AppExchange to assess available onboarding and HR apps for integration opportunities or inspiration.

Evaluated apps for features, UI/UX, and feedback to incorporate innovative practices into the project’s design.
